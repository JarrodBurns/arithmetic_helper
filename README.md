# Virtual Chalkboard Arithmetic Formatter

This application takes input from a user and returns results formatted as if on a virtual chalkboard.

## Purpose
This program was designed with a number of limitations for the purpose of error handling. Therefore, you will find the following restrictions are in place:

- Only addition and subtraction are supported
- Numbers cannot be greater than four in length
- No more than five problems can be submitted at one time
- Each number must contain only digits
- Only valid inputs are accepted

The class and method of construction I employed allow for the easy implementation of new features and restriction removal. If you are interested in adding a few new features, (such as multiplication or more problems) it should require minimal work.

## Usage
To get started, load up your terminal of choice. I personally use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Then, to run the program, type "python main.py" from the application directory

If executed correctly you should be greeted by the MoTD.

## Version Control
Virtual Chalkboard is dependent on the following:

- [python](https://docs.python.org/3/) 3.9.6
